## Overview

The Solana Data Reverser is a browser-based tool designed for developers and analysts working with the Solana blockchain. This tool allows users to reverse engineer hex data, providing a clear visualization of binary structures. With its deep integration into the Solana ecosystem, it helps users understand account structures and discover patterns within blockchain data.

## Features

### Core Functionality

- **Interactive Hexdump Viewer**  
  View your hex data in an interactive format. Each byte is clickable, allowing for detailed examination. Color-coded highlighting helps you quickly identify different data types.

- **Smart Suggestions**  
  The tool employs AI to detect patterns in your data. It provides confidence scores to help you assess the reliability of the detected patterns.

- **Multi-format Decoding**  
  Decode various data formats with ease. The tool supports integers, floats, strings, timestamps, and Solana-specific types, making it versatile for different use cases.

- **Visual Feedback**  
  Color-coded byte states provide instant visual feedback. Green indicates decoded bytes, blue represents staged bytes, and glowing blue shows maximum confidence.

### Solana Integration

- **Account Analysis**  
  Fetch and analyze Solana accounts directly within the tool. This feature simplifies the process of examining account data.

- **Pubkey Detection**  
  Automatically detect valid Solana public keys. The tool verifies the existence of these keys, ensuring accuracy in your analysis.

- **Program Recognition**  
  Access a built-in database of known Solana programs. This feature allows for quick identification of programs associated with specific data.
